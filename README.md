# goal of this repo

show the differences between oo and fp paradigms in the implementation of the rubiks cube
First comparison between oo and fp in javascript.
Then a comparison between fp in javascript and fp in clojure.
-oo.js 
-fp.js
-fp.clj

## rubiks cube solving method

Roux method is used as a foundation for a bigger idea,
which is to make an app to guide persons from zero to solve the cube using the Roux method.
The intend is not only for them to have a solved cube, but also to understand the major steps of the method.
Then if they want to go a little further to solve it by themselves, formulas will be given with more documentation of the method, and some very good videos that taught me how to solve it with this method.


### more on Roux method

The Roux method in its prestine form is quite difficult to understand, it took me more than a week end to decipher it 
and not even solve the cube completly.
You can see it by yourself visiting Giles Roux's website : http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html


### history of the project

It's been a long time since I've first been interested in Rubiks cube.
Solving it in python has been one of my first programming projects 5 years ago.
The almost 3k lines of code source code in python is quite convoluted, it is "spaghetti code" in its purest form.
Yet it has the virtue of being almost functional, not messed up with class hiarachies.
Now with more knowledge and skills on clean code, this is for me a way to see in what ways I produce "cleaner" code.
